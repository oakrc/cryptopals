* Notes
- cipher text = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" XOR key
- It's even simpler with CTR.
- Just replace third block with: third block XOR "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" XOR ";admin=true;aaaa"
  - First XOR cancels out original plain text. Now the plain text is just null bytes
  - Second XOR adds the token. The plain text has been edited to our liking.
