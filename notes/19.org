#+title: Breaking CTR with fixed nonces
#+roam_tags:

* Brainstorm
- Fixed nonces + same key = same keystream

* Guess keystream one byte at a time
- For each block of cipher
- Let known_key = 0
- For each char pos i (not exceeding the longest cipher)
  - Let best = (kb, score)
  - For each possible key byte kb
    - Let sum = 0
    - For each cipher (that are long enough)
      - plain_guess = xor(kb XOR cipher[i])
      - Increase sum by the score(plain_guess)
    - If current score less than best, best = current
  - known_key += best.kb
