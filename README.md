# Cryptopals Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for the [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges.

# Organization
Each challenge `num` may contain 1 or more of the following
- `num.py` contains the solution code
- `data/num.txt` contains the challenge data
- `notes/num.md` contains scratch notes I made when writing the script
- `mycrypto.py` contains code created in previous challenges that are (or might be) reused in later challenges.

# Prerequisites
```sh
pip install pycryptodome
```
